    <h2>Weapons ranked from worst to best</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cursed Sword - </strong>Powerful but you die in one hit. Not worth it.</li>
            <li><strong>Spartan Sandals - </strong>Does basically no damage and only is good if your kicking enemies into walls.</li>
            <li><strong>Tentacle - </strong>Does a little bit of damage and allows you to move faster my grabbing on to enemies and walls.</li>
            <li><strong>Symmetrical Lance - </strong>Does major damage on both sides of you and does critical hits after killing three enemies.</li>
            <li><strong>Shovel - </strong>You get to hit people with  shovel. Enough said.</li>
        </ol>
