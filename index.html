                <strong>Cursed Sword</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Cursed Sword does 554 base damage which is more than any weapon in the game.</li>
                    <li>You will die in one hit no matter what you do.</li>
                    <li>Too much of a risk to be any good.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><img src='https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deadcells_gamepedia_en/images/a/a3/Spartan_Sandals_Icon.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/48?cb=20170801224149'>
                <strong>Spartan Sandals</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Spartan Sandals do a pitiful 32 base damage on their own.</li>
                    <li>The only way to do any bonus dase is to kick enemies into a wall which will not always be available.</li>
                    <li>Only grab if incredibly desperate.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><img src='https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deadcells_gamepedia_en/images/b/b7/Tentacle_Icon.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/48?cb=20200513155751'>
                <strong>Tentacle</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Tentacle does 79 base damage which isn't a lot but will score criticals if you press the attack button again after sticking to an enemy.</li>
                    <li>This weapon allows you to latch on to enemies and wall in order to bring you closer to them.</li>
                    <li>Better used for increased mobility rather than a weapon.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><img src='https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deadcells_gamepedia_en/images/0/09/Symmetrical_Lance_Icon.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/48?cb=20180303232548'>
                <strong>Symmetrical Lance</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Symmetrical Lance does 194 base which is definitely one of the more powerful weapons in the whole game.</li>
                    <li>This weapon does critical hits for 6 seconds after you kill 2 enemies in a row which then does 288 base damage.</li>
                    <li>This also does damage on both side of you so this is a pretty good weapon for later on in the game.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><img src='https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deadcells_gamepedia_en/images/2/28/Shovel_Icon.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/48?cb=20170801224131'>
                <strong>Shovel</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>THIS IS THE BEST WEAPON IN THE ENTIRE GAME DOING 999999999999 DAMAGE AT ALL TIMES!</li>
                    <li>YOU CAN SMACK BOMBS BACK AT ENEMIES TO GIVE THEM A TASTE OF SWEET REVENGE!</li>
                    <li>GOT ENEMIES SURROUNDING YOU? NO PROBLEM! GIVE THEM THE SWIFT BOP TO THE FACE AND SEND THEM FLYING!</li>
                    <li>TAKE THIS IF YOU ABSOLUTELY WANT TO DESTROY YOUR ENEMIES AND MAKE SURE THEY WISH THEY NEVER PICKED A FIGHT WITH YOUR GREATNESS!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
